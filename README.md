SQL serves as the linchpin for E-commerce sales by providing a structured and efficient means to manage, query, and analyze vast datasets. Its role in maintaining data integrity, supporting real-time decision-making, and enabling insightful reporting makes SQL an indispensable tool for E-commerce professionals navigating the complexities of online retail.

This project allowed me to successfully address and resolve the different SQL queries.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION :
First I created a database named 'org'. Then I created multiple tables like customers, products, orders, orderdetails for the e-commerce sales inside the database.

Then I tried to solve following queries:
1.	Basic Queries:
1.1.	List all customers.
1.2.	Show all products in the 'Electronics' category.
1.3.	Find the total number of orders placed.
1.4.	Display the details of the most recent order.

2.	Joins and Relationships:
2.1.	List all products along with the names of the customers who ordered them.
2.2.	Show orders that include more than one product.
2.3.	Find the total sales amount for each customer.

3.	Aggregation and Grouping:
3.1.	Calculate the total revenue generated by each product category.
3.2.	Determine the average order value.
3.3.	Find the month with the highest number of orders.

4.	Subqueries and Nested Queries:
4.1.	Identify customers who have not placed any orders.
4.2.	Find products that have never been ordered.
4.3.	Show the top 3 best-selling products.

5.	Date and Time Functions:
5.1.	List orders placed in the last month.
5.2.	Determine the oldest customer in terms of membership duration.

6.	Advanced Queries:
6.1.	Rank customers based on their total spending.
6.2.	Identify the most popular product category.
6.3.	Calculate the month-over-month growth rate in sales.
